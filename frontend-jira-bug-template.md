##### notes: 

When filing a bug, please make sure you include a screenshot, or a URL, or the frontend version string, or mention where you saw the bug (e.g. nightly, usage), so that we can know what version of the software you were looking at.  

Please also set the affects version field if you can, e.g. 3.0 for usage or 3.1 for nightly.  

When resolving a bug, please make sure the fix version field is set correctly for the branch you landed the fix on, and fill in the affects version field too if it's missing.  

When verifying a bug, please make sure that affects version and fix version fields are set, and make sure the version you're verifying against is correct for the fix version.  In all cases, you can list the earliest version affected or fixed, e.g. instead of putting both 3.0 and 3.1, just put 3.0.
